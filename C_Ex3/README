In the first part of this exercise i have created a static library in order to help me
compute with high precision two well known values in calculus: the Derivative and the Integral.
These two values are numerically computed in accordance with the given exercise description.
In the second part of this exercise i have implemented a simple program named "NumericalAnalyzer"
which uses "infi.c" static library in order to compute the two previous values.
Most of NumericalAnalyzer.c file is dedicated for validating the users input,
furthermore, in order to ensure that the users input corresponds with the functions domain
i have used a global valuable to flag whether or not we are in the given function domain.
In this exercise there were no run time limitations, and i have not used any
interesting algorithms.
