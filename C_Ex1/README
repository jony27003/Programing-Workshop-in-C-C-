In this exercise we have implemented the mathematical concept of
convolution. One of this exercises requirements was to implement it in no more than O(n^2) time,
and this exercise was indeed implemented in O(n^2) time.
The trail of thought for implementing this exercise was to first to get familiar
with working with users input and analyzing them accordingly.
Then the next challenge was to convert the mathematical language of convolution
operation to based c language, this was accomplished by implementing the parametrization
according to this exercise description.
In order to implement this exercise i used primitive variables
(such as: int, char, double) and some arrays of different kinds as well.
