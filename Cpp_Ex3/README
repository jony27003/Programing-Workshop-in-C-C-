In this exercise i have created a spam detector program that classifies messages that might be
harmful for the user and lets them know about it. in order to accomplish this, i have
created and stored a bank of harmful values and there keys in a hashMap,
and then if a given message has used a sufficient number of harmful values,
it will be categorized as spam.
In this exercise i have created 4 classes:
"HashMap", "HashMapIterator", "SpamDetector" and "OutOfRange".
HashMap: a generic hashMap.
HashMapIterator: a HashMap iterator.
SpamDetector: the spam detector program.
OutOfRange: a customized exception class.
i have not used any complex or well known algorithms, and there were no runtime
demands on any of the requested methods.
