In this exercise i have wrote a part of a program which is intended to break RSA encryption.
This was done by implementing a finite algebraic field class GField and an
algorithm to extract the prime roots of a given number.
A short explanation of the implemented classes:
GField: A class that represents a Galois field.
GFNumber: A class that represents a number in a a Galois field.
IntegerFactorization: A class that holds the main function from which the -
- output desired output of the program is generated.
The implementation of the classes above is written with accordance to the given API.
Run time requirements: isPrime -> O(sqrt(n)), this rum time was achieved.
